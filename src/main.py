                System: The system message helps set the behavior of the assistant. For example, you can modify the personality
                of the assistant or provide specific instructions about how it should behave throughout the conversation.
                However note that the system message is optional and the modelâ€™s behavior without a system message is likely to
                be similar to using a generic message such as "You are a helpful assistant.

                User: The user messages provide requests or comments for the assistant to respond to.

                Assistant: Assistant messages store previous assistant responses, but can also be written by you to give 
                examples of desired behavior.

                  means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.
